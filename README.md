# ENGR 162 Project-3 

## Description
This purpose of this project is to create a robot prototpye that would be used in disaster relief
scenarios that is able to navigate a disaster zone and deliver supplies to personnel in need.
To accomplish this, our robot is able to navigate through a maze while simultaneously mapping
and keeping track of its current position in addition to recording hazards that it encounters
throughout the maze. Once the robot has exited the maze, it will deposit a payload to the
community in need.

## Project Status
Mapping modudle has just been test and is now being integrated into the main
wall navigation algorithm in main.
